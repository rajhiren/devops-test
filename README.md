# devops-test
test for devops

# My Understanding
  - `hello-world-deploy.yaml` is an example of Deployment. It will create a `ReplicaSet` to bring up a single `devops-test` Pod
  - We are creating a Deployment named `devops-test`, which is indicated by `.metadata.name`
  - The Deployment create a single pod indicated by `replicas` field
  - We are using ramped deployment updates pods in rolling update fashion where `maxSurge` indicates only 1 pod can add at a time and setting `maxUnavailable` to 0 would make sure we have the appropriate capacity during the rolling update.
  - The `template` field contains the following sub-fields:
    - The Pods are labeled `app: devops-test` using the `labels` field.
    - The Pod templateâ€™s specification, or `.template.spec` field, indicates that the Pods run one container, `devops:test`
    - this creates one container and name it `devops-hello-world` using the `name` field
  - `imagePullPolicy: Never` indicates that local image is used
  - Container has `memory` of 2GB and it's max limit is also 2GB.
  - `volumeMounts` suggests that we have `config-volume` named volume set at pod level and `mountPath` shows mounting path for that directory in our container

  - I was confused that why we have `heap size = 12GB` in Dockerfile but when only initialising `2GB` while creating pod. We need to have select same memory size for both. 

# Issue with Dockerfile
  - we should never ever use `latest` for `FROM`.
    1. `latest` is not dynamic so it doesn't guarantee that latest is actually the latest version of app
    2. It can be easily overwritten by default
    3. Kubernetes reference docs are very clear on avoiding `latest` tag in our case we should follow that (ref https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/overview/#container-images)

  - we should replace `MAINTAINER` with `LABEL maintainer` because it has been deprecated (ref: https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/), Also it will help tremendously when using `docker inspect`

  - some nice to have changes but not really a deal breaker
    1. use `WORKDIR` so it is easily maintainable for future if we have to change anything. Also, it helps with clarity and reliability of Dockerfile
